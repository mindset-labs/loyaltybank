## 💡 Motivation

The goal of Open Rewards is to provide a simple and easy-to-use API for developers to integrate rewards into their applications. We believe that rewards are a great way to engage users and build loyalty, and we want to make it easy for developers to add rewards to their applications.

Most small business may not have the resources to build a rewards system from scratch, and that's where Open Rewards comes in. With Open Rewards, developers can quickly and easily integrate rewards into their applications, without having to worry about the complexity of building a rewards system from scratch.

Points systems are a great way to engage users and build loyalty, and Open Rewards makes it easy to add a points system to your application. With Open Rewards, you can reward users for completing certain actions, such as making a purchase, referring a friend, or sharing your app on social media. You can also set up different rewards levels, so that users can earn more points as they complete more actions.
